# Mini-shop-svelte

This repository is experimenting how's SSR and animation working with svelete kit.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Creating a project

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn` or `bun`), start a development server:

```bash
bun dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
bun run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `bun run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
